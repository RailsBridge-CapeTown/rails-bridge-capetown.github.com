  <p class="hero">Free Ruby on Rails workshops for women and their friends.</p>

  <p>
    The RailsBridge Workshop is a free one-and-a-bit day course run by a volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic developers. It aims to promote diversity in the software industry by providing an accessible starting point to women interested in coding. The course covers an introduction to programming concepts, the available tools, and Ruby and Rails development techniques. It teaches practical skills useful to those investigating new career paths, looking to compliment their current skill set, or simply interested in gaining a better understanding of software.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attendees should identify as a woman, and can bring a guest of any gender. You should be comfortable using a computer, but no programming experience or hardware expertise is required. You should have your own laptop to bring along. Mac, Windows, and Linux machines are welcome.

  <h3 id="theworkshop">The Workshop</h3>

  <p>
    A RailsBridge event is:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      an <strong>InstallFest</strong> on Friday night, with drinks and snacks, where we help you <strong>set up your computer with the software you&#8217;ll need</strong>; and
    </li>
    <li>
      an all-day <strong>Workshop</strong> on Saturday, including breakfast and lunch, where you&#8217;ll <strong>learn to use both Ruby and Rails to build and publish a web application</strong>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You&#8217;ll be given sufficient background and confidence to continue developing their Rails skills independently. We&#8217;ll be teaching in English and Afrikaans.
  </p>

  <p>The Friday night InstallFest is about software, snacks, and sharing. It's about unwinding from your day and preparing for the next day's adventure.</p>

  <p>The Saturday workshop is quite informal. You'll work through <a href="http://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/">the documentation</a> at your own pace, asking questions and getting answer from yourself, the other attendees, and from teachers who are close by in case you would like some help.</p>
