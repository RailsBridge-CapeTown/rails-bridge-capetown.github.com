        <strong>Marc Heiligers</strong> turns liquid input into code output. The quality and creativeness of the code depends on the type, quantity and quality of the input liquid and time of day. The current recommended input is <span id='marc_input'></span>.<script>
        (function() {
          var translate = { 'C': 'Coffee', 'I': 'Cider', 'S': 'Scotch', 'L': 'Litchi Juice', 'B': 'Beer' },

    <li><p><strong>Steve Barnett</strong> Steve has a background in Maths and finance and started work as a Front End Developer in 2005, escaping to South Africa from his native England. He works at <a href="http://userexperience.co.za/">Flow Interactive</a>, and he&#8217;s most interested in the multi-device world and making the web accessible to all. You can find him at <a href="http://naga.co.za/">naga.co.za</a> or on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/maxbarners">@maxbarners</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Rich Archer</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/slocombe" title="@slocombe">Rich</a> has an animation background, where he discovered a love of agonising over minuti&aelig; that most people don't notice or, indeed, care about. This transferred easily into web development 12 years ago and he now sweats the details over how fast his JavaScript runs in Android browsers and whether he really <i>should</i> have used an '&aelig;' in that last sentence.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Heidi de Villiers</strong> is a tickled pink ScrumMaster for wacko DevOps masterminds at Hetzner who's obsessed with Battlefield and talking nonsence. Passionate about accelerating agile, girl going geek, confessed shoe addict and periodic troublemaker!</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Cara Turner</strong> is an agile coach with a passion for creating a positive working experience in complex environments. Facilitation is her tool of choice to harness team knowledge and direct meaningful change. Her ultimate aim is for us all to find autonomy, mastery and purpose in our work.</p></li>
