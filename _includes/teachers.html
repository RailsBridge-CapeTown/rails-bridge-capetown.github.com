  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Nina Schiff</strong> works as part of the AWS EC2 team, building things in the cloud (but mainly getting to grips with many more acronyms). In her free time she helps run <a href="http://www.umonya.org">Umonya</a>, an organisation that teaches school kids to code. She can also touch type with just two fingers.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Rory McKinley</strong> has been letting software escape into the wild for more than 12 years. He works at Hetzner, where he is lucky enough to work with people who are a lot smarter than he is.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Ben Janecke</strong> loves bad jokes thinks far too highly of javascript and node.js and works on bridging the gap between the front and back end of things at Unboxed Consulting.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Marc Heiligers</strong> turns liquid input into code output. The quality and creativeness of the code depends on the type, quantity and quality of the input liquid and time of day. The current recommended input is <span id='marc_input'></span>.<script>
        (function() {
          var translate = { 'C': 'Coffee', 'I': 'Cider', 'S': 'Scotch', 'L': 'Litchi Juice', 'B': 'Beer' },
              recommendation = 'CCCCCCCCCCCCIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCCCCLLLLLLSSSSSCCCCCCCCCCCCCLLLLLLSSSSSCCCCCCCCCCCCCLLLLLLSSSSSCCCCCCCCCCCCCLLLLLLSSSSSCCCCCCCCCCCCCLLLLBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCCCIIIIIBBBBBBB';
          function recommend(now) {
            if(!now) now = new Date();
            document.getElementById('marc_input').innerHTML = translate[recommendation.charAt(now.getDay() * 24 + now.getHours() - 1)];
          }
          recommend();
          setInterval(recommend, 1000);
        })();
        </script></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Elizabeth Braae</strong></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Wiehann Radyn</strong> has been using Ruby on Rails to create elegant software for the past 5 years. He currently works at Platform45.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Rizmari Versfeld</strong></p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Greg Kempe</strong> writes code, swims and bakes bread. Not always at the same time. You can find him at <a href="http://kempe.net">kempe.net</a> or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/longhotsummer">@longhotsummer</a>.</p></li>

    <li><p><strong>Steve Barnett</strong> Steve has a background in Maths and finance and started work as a Front End Developer in 2005, escaping to South Africa from his native England. He works at <a href="http://userexperience.co.za/">Flow Interactive</a>, and he&#8217;s most interested in the multi-device world and making the web accessible to all. You can find him at <a href="http://naga.co.za/">naga.co.za</a> or on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/maxbarners">@maxbarners</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Rich Archer</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/slocombe" title="@slocombe">Rich</a> has an animation background, where he discovered a love of agonising over minuti&aelig; that most people don't notice or, indeed, care about. This transferred easily into web development 12 years ago and he now sweats the details over how fast his JavaScript runs in Android browsers and whether he really <i>should</i> have used an '&aelig;' in that last sentence.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Heidi de Villiers</strong> is a tickled pink ScrumMaster for wacko DevOps masterminds at Hetzner who's obsessed with Battlefield and talking nonsence. Passionate about accelerating agile, girl going geek, confessed shoe addict and periodic troublemaker!</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Cara Turner</strong> is an agile coach with a passion for creating a positive working experience in complex environments. Facilitation is her tool of choice to harness team knowledge and direct meaningful change. Her ultimate aim is for us all to find autonomy, mastery and purpose in our work.</p></li>
