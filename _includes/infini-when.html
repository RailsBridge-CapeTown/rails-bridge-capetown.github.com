      Past Events
    </h3>

    <p>We try to run events every three months. We've had them in <a href="/2013-07.html">July</a> and <a href="/2013-10.html">October</a> of 2013, <a href="/2014-01.html">January</a>, <a href="/2014-04.html">April</a>, <a href="/2014-07.html">July</a>, October of 2014, and February of 2015. We also had two special events: one for <a href="http://www.girlhype.co.za/">GirlHype</a>, and one for some students at <a href="http://railsbridgecapetown.org/2014/10/20/railsbridge-at-herschel.html">Herschel school</a>.</p>

Spoiler alert: pretty good, we think!</p>
