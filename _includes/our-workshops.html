  <h3 id="theworkshop">Our Workshops</h3>

  <p><a href="https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/docs/">Our documentation</a> has Rails, Front-end, JavaScript, and Ruby courses. We tend to run the <a href="https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/intro-to-rails/">Intro to Rails</a> course, because we like it and it's had the most work done on making it awesome.</p>

  <p>
    Here's what a RailsBridge <strong>Intro to Rails</strong> event is like.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      an <strong>InstallFest</strong> on Friday night where we help you <strong>set up your computer with the software you&#8217;ll need</strong>. We provide drinks and snacks.
    </li>
    <li>
      an all-day <strong>Workshop</strong> on Saturday where you&#8217;ll <strong>learn to use both Ruby and Rails to build and publish a web application</strong>. We provide breakfast and lunch.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You&#8217;ll be given sufficient background and confidence to continue developing their Rails skills independently. We&#8217;ll be teaching in English and Afrikaans.
  </p>

  <p>The Friday night InstallFest is about software, snacks, and sharing. It's about unwinding from your day and preparing for the next day's adventure.</p>

  <p>The Saturday workshop is quite informal. You'll work through <a href="http://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/">the documentation</a> at your own pace, asking questions and getting answer from yourself, the other attendees, and from teachers who are close by in case you would like some help.</p>
