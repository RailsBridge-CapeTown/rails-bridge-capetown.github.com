        <strong>Rich Archer</strong>
         (<a href="https://twitter.com/slocombe" title="@slocombe">@slocombe</a>) has an animation background, where he discovered a love of agonising over minuti&aelig; that most people don't notice or, indeed, care about. This transferred easily into web development 12 years ago and he now sweats the details over how fast his JavaScript runs in Android browsers and whether he really <i>should</i> have used an '&aelig;' in that last sentence.</p>
