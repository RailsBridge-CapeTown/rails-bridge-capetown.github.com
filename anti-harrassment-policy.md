# Anti-Harassment Policy

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, native language, operating system choice or prior experience. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from an event or virtual forum at our discretion.

Harassment includes sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact [a teacher or organiser](http://www.meetup.com/RailsBridge-Cape-Town/members/?op=leaders) immediately. Teachers and organisers will identify themselves during the opening remarks of every event, and will be wearing an appropriate nametag.
