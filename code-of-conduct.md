<h1 id="codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</h1>

We seek to create a community of software developers that are reflective of the diversity in the general population. To that end, we are dedicated to creating welcoming and friendly learning environments.

All participants agree to the following for virtual and in-person events:

* Everyone has something to contribute. Everyone deserves access to materials and community that will help them learn. As long as an individual can be respectful and not disruptive to other participants, they deserve to participate.
* Anyone is welcome to replicate an event, such that more opportunities may be available. All curricula and organising materials are open source and free. You can find the materials at [docs.railsbridgecapetown.org](http://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/); the source code is available at [github.com/RailsBridge-CapeTown/docs](https://github.com/RailsBridge-CapeTown/docs).
* A harassment-free experience for everyone is essential. [See our anti-harassment policy](anti-harrassment-policy.html)
