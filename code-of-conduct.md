# Code of Conduct

We want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the workshop events.

RailsBridge Cape Town is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We will not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form, be it verbal comments, imagery, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of lectures, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Workshop participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers.

If you are being harassed, see someone else being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the workshop organizers or teachers immediately.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
