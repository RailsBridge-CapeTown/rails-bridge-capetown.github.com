  <p class="hero">Free Ruby on Rails workshops for women and their friends.</p>

  <p>The RailsBridge Workshop is a free one-and-a-bit day course run by a volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic developers. It aims to promote diversity in the software industry by providing an accessible starting point to women interested in coding. The course covers an introduction to programming concepts, the available tools, and Ruby and Rails development techniques. It teaches practical skills useful to those investigating new career paths, looking to compliment their current skill set, or simply interested in gaining a better understanding of software.</p>

  <p>Attendees should identify as a woman, and can bring a guest of any gender. You should be comfortable using a computer, but no programming experience or hardware expertise is required. You should have your own laptop to bring along. Mac, Windows, and Linux machines are welcome.</p>

  <p>The workshop consists of</p>

  <ul>
    <li>an InstallFest on Friday night, with drinks and snacks, where we help you set up your computer with the software you&#8217;ll need; and</li>
    <li>an all-day Workshop on Saturday, including breakfast and lunch, where you&#8217;ll learn to use both Ruby and Rails to build and publish a web application.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Participants will be given sufficient background and confidence to continue developing their Rails skills independently.</p>

  <p>We&#8217;ll be teaching in English and Afrikaans.</p>
