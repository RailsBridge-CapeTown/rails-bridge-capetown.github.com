  <p class="hero">Free Ruby on Rails workshops for women and their friends.</p>

  <p>The RailsBridge Workshop is a free one-and-a-bit day course run by <a href="#teachers">a volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic developers</a>. It aims to promote diversity in the software industry by providing an accessible starting point to women interested in coding. The course covers an introduction to programming concepts, the available tools, and Ruby and Rails development techniques. It teaches practical skills useful to those investigating new career paths, looking to compliment their current skill set, or simply interested in gaining a better understanding of software.</p>

  <p>Attendees should identify as a woman, and can bring a guest of any gender. You should be comfortable using a computer, but no programming experience or hardware expertise is required. You should have your own laptop to bring along. Mac, Windows, and Linux machines are welcome.</p>

  <p>The workshop consists of</p>

  <ul>
    <li>an InstallFest on Friday night, with drinks and snacks, where we help you set up your computer with the software you&#8217;ll need; and</li>
    <li>an all-day Workshop on Saturday, including breakfast and lunch, where you&#8217;ll learn to use both Ruby and Rails to build and publish a web application.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Participants will be given sufficient background and confidence to continue developing their Rails skills independently.</p>

  <p>We&#8217;ll be teaching in English and Afrikaans.</p>

  <h2 id="teachers">Teachers</h2>

  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Pawel Janiak</strong> He loves Ruby. He has a crush on JavaScript. He makes terrible jokes. <a href="http://paweljaniak.co.za/">paweljaniak.co.za</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Joerg Diekmann</strong> Joerg runs an online pagination tool for the magazine industry called <a href="http://www.blinkplan.com" title="Online magazine pagination (or flatplans)">Blinkplan</a>. He strives to maintain traditional German excellence in all the code he writes. He also builds watches in his spare time. You can find him at <a href="http://brea.kfa.st">brea.kfa.st</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Carina Viljoen</strong> By day (and sometimes by night too) she has her head in the Cloud working for AWS. She likes challenges and the latest one has been delving into the Rails realm. She codes on a bright pink Hello Kitty keyboard because that's just bad ass.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Stuart Corbishley</strong> Stuart is an experienced software developer specializing in Ruby, Rails and systems integration. Having a background in scaling and automation he is also a practiced photographer, bringing a passion for simple and beautiful designs inside and out.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Nina Schiff</strong> Nina works as part of the AWS EC2 team, building things in the cloud (but mainly getting to grips with many more acronyms). In her free time she helps run <a href="www.umonya.org">Umonya</a>, an organisation that teaches school kids to code. She can also touch type with just two fingers.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Glenn Roberts</strong> Glenn kicks ass, and persists names in a nosql database.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Luke Randall</strong> Outside of software development, his hobbies include finding new hobbies to pursue intently for 1 - 3 months, and selling equipment from abandoned hobbies on the Internet. He once wrote a quine in Ruby.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Sandra Randall</strong> Sandra is from a HR / IT Recruitment background. Ruby sparked an interest when faced with the difficult task of finding and hiring developers - she decided to find out what all the fuss was about and has been creating chaos for the past 18 months. </p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Rory McKinley</strong> Rory has been letting software escape into the wild for more than 12 years. He works at Hetzner, where he is lucky enough to work with people who are a lot smarter than he is.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Sheldon Hearn</strong> People have been paying Sheldon to write software for 16 years, and he's been doing most of it with Ruby for the last 8. He thinks these numbers are very important. He also works at Hetzner, where he works tirelessly to improve Rory's taste in music.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="organisers">Organisers</h2>

  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Steve Barnett</strong> Steve has a background in Maths and finance and started work as a Front End Developer in 2005, escaping to South Africa from his native England. He started at <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com/">Unboxed Consulting</a> in November 2012, and he&#8217;s most interested in the multi-device world and making the web accessible to all. You can find him at <a href="http://naga.co.za/">naga.co.za</a> or on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/maxbarners">@maxbarners</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Rich Archer</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/slocombe" title="@slocombe">Rich</a> has an animation background, where he discovered a love of agonising over minuti&aelig; that most people don't notice or, indeed, care about. This transferred easily into web development 12 years ago and he now sweats the details over how fast his JavaScript runs in Android browsers and whether he really <i>should</i> have used an '&aelig;' in that last sentence.</p>
  <li><p><strong>Andrew Higson-Smith</strong> Andrew has worked professionally as a programmer since he left school, using a broad range of operating systems, languages and technologies over the years. Currently he consults on several medium sized technical projects under the banner of Elementalsystems.
