## General Workshop outline

The shape of each piece changes a little each time, but the main shape of mixing workshopping with (learning- and learner- focused) activities is the same. A word-y write-up of this is in [this blog post from February](/2017/02/07/february-2017.html).

- **Opening presentation**. Make a fresh copy of one of the latest one in our [presentations repository on GitHub](https://github.com/RailsBridge-CapeTown/presentations).

- [Print-outs for the wall](https://github.com/RailsBridge-CapeTown/Activity-Printables/blob/master/three-most-important-things.pdf) up on the wall so that people don't have to remember a bunch of instructions.
