# Is this workshop for you?

People come to our workshops with a range of experience and expectations. We offer a **social learning environment** where people can connect to a community that is excited to teach what they know, with a shared belief that **everyone has something to learn**. We don't expect that you will learn all you need to learn in one day, but **one day is usually enough to figure out whether you want to learn more**. If you decide to join a workshop, you will be in a group of people with different levels of experience and motivations.

## You want to start learning to code

- You're **programming-curious and want to gain a better understanding of software**. You might work with a team of programmers and want to be more familiar with what they do, or you might have an idea for a thing you want to build.
- You're **investigating new career paths** and becoming a software developer is one of them.

## You want to level up

- You want to **get back into a technical career** after being away from tech for a while.
- You're interested in professional development and **want something to compliment your current skill set**. You might want to use programming more effectively in your work.
- You want to **learn a new language or framework**, or **level up your skills** in one you're already familiar with.

## You want to connect

- You want a **friendly, safe, judgement-free space** to learn where you can gain enough background and confidence to continue developing your skills independently.
- You want a **diverse volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic developers** who can help you learn and give you perspective through experience.
- You want to **connect with the local software development community** and gain access to a network of connected professionals who care deeply about software and learning.
