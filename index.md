#RailsBridge Cape Town

## What

**Free Ruby on Rails workshops for women and their friends.**

The RailsBridge Workshop is a free 1-and-a-bit day course run by a volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic developers. It is designed to provide people of all backgrounds with an introduction to programming concepts, the tools available, and the techniques of Ruby and Rails development. It will help if you are generally proficient with computers. To attend, you should identify as a woman, or be the male guest of a woman who is attending.

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a free, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity, and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is a web application framework: a reusable set of shortcuts that help you build dynamic web sites.

We'll be teaching in English, but we also have Afrikaans-speaking teachers.


## Why

We would like to help improve diversity and the gender ratio in the Cape Town tech community. A lack of diversity in the workplace affects everyone.
