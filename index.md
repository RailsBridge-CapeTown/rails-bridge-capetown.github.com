# RailsBridge Cape Town

## What

**Free Ruby on Rails workshops for women and their friends.**

The RailsBridge Workshop is a free 1-and-a-bit day course run by a volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic developers. It is designed to provide people of all backgrounds with an introduction to programming concepts, the tools available, and the techniques of Ruby and Rails development.

To attend, you should identify as a woman, or be the male guest of a woman who is attending. You should be comfortable using a computer, but no programming experience or hardware expertise is required.

If you have your own laptop you should bring it along. We like Macs, but Windows and Linux machines are very welcome too.

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a free, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity, and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is a web application framework: a reusable set of shortcuts that help you build dynamic web sites.

The workshop is made up of

* an InstallFest on Friday night, with drinks and finger food, where we help you set up your computer with the software you'll need; and
* an all-day Workshop on Saturday, including breakfast and lunch, where you learn to use both Ruby and Rails, and build a web app.


### Additional Information

We won't have childcare facilities at the venue, unfortunately, but please let us know if we can help organising or finding childcare for while you're at the workshop.

We'll be teaching in English, but we also have Afrikaans-speaking teachers.


## Why

We would like to help improve diversity and the gender ratio in the Cape Town tech community because a lack of diversity in the workplace affects everyone.

We want to show people new to programming examples of smart, confident, capable programmers of all backgrounds.

We want to show how programming skills are useful, empowering, and fun, especially when applied to the web.

We want to bring more people into the local Ruby community through diversity and outreach events, and help more user groups think about diversity and outreach.

## Teachers

* **Pawel Janiak** He loves Ruby. He's got a crush on JavaScript. He makes terrible jokes.


* **Joerg Diekmann** South Africa's greatest Rails developer. His nickname is Jurgen. It's short for Jörg. He answers to both, because he's a pretty chill guy. He strives to maintain traditional German excellence in all the code he writes. He also builds watches in his spare time. ... He is a lumberjack.

* **Stuart Corbishley** Stuart is an experienced software developer specializing in Ruby, Rails and systems integration. Having a background in scaling and automation he is also a practiced photographer, bringing a passion for simple and beautiful designs inside and out.

* **Sachin Ranchod** Sachin is a Ruby developer who joined Siyelo after escaping the management consulting world. He comes packing experience in business analysis, project management, user experience (UX) design and beard growing.

* **Glenn Roberts** Glenn is the founder and lead developer at Siyelo. He brings over 12 years of professional software development experience and a rather strange sense of humor to the team.

* **Nic Young** Nic has seven years of professional development experience, and is a published author of short fiction. He thinks Haskell is the demanding supermodel of languages, and Ruby the girl next door. He brings unnecessary metaphors to the team.

* **Luke Randall**

* **Sandra Randall**

## Organisers

* **Steve Barnett** Steve has a background in Maths and finance and started work as a Front End Developer in 2005, escaping to South Africa from his native England. He started at Unboxed Consulting in November 2012, and he's most interested in the multi-device world and making the web accessible to all.

* **Rich Archer** He's been working as a front-end developer for 6 years in London, but recently upped sticks and moved to beautiful Cape Town. He loves that he gets to work with a fantastic team of like-minded folk that are all as passionate about the web as him, and gets to enjoy the beach, beer and braai lifestyle of South Africa at the same time.

* **Andrew Higson-Smith** Andrew has worked professionally as a programmer since he left school, using a broad range of operating systems, languages and technologies over the years. Currently he consults on several medium sized technical projects under the banner of Elementalsystems.
