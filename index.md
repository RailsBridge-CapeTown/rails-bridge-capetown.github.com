# RailsBridge Cape Town

## What

**Free Ruby on Rails workshops for women and their friends.**

The RailsBridge Workshop is a free 1-and-a-bit day course run by a volunteer team of experienced and enthusiastic developers. It is designed to provide people of all backgrounds with an introduction to programming concepts, the tools available, and the techniques of Ruby and Rails development.

To attend, you should identify as a woman, or be the male guest of a woman who is attending. You should be comfortable using a computer, but no programming experience or hardware expertise is required.

If you have your own laptop you should bring it along. We like Macs, but Windows and Linux machines are very welcome too.

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is a free, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity, and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is a web application framework: a reusable set of shortcuts that help you build dynamic web sites.

The workshop is made up of

* an InstallFest on Friday night, with drinks and finger food, where we help you set up your computer with the software you'll need; and
* an all-day Workshop on Saturday, including breakfast and lunch, where you learn to use both Ruby and Rails, and build a web app.


### Additional Information

We won't have childcare facilities at the venue, unfortunately, but please let us know if we can help organising or finding childcare for while you're at the workshop.

We'll be teaching in English, but we also have Afrikaans-speaking teachers.


## Why

We would like to help improve diversity and the gender ratio in the Cape Town tech community because a lack of diversity in the workplace affects everyone.

We want to show people new to programming examples of smart, confident, capable programmers of all backgrounds.

We want to show how programming skills are useful, empowering, and fun, especially when applied to the web.

We want to bring more people into the local Ruby community through diversity and outreach events, and help more user groups think about diversity and outreach.
