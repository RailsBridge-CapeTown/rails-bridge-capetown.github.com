title: RailsBridge April 2016
---

This Saturday saw a couple of firsts for RailsBridge Cape Town. We ran a double-up workshop (of the [front-end course](https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/frontend/) course and the [Job Board course](https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/job-board/) course), and we were at the American Corner (find them [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ACCapeTown/), [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ACCape/)) at [the Cape Town Central Library](https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/Library/Pages/default.aspx). We hope we'll be repeating both! :)

## Sponsors

Thank you to the American Corner for providing the venue and free Wi-Fi for our attendees, and thank you to [Platform 45](http://platform45.com) (a frequent, generous, sponsor!) for sponsoring food and drink during the day.

## Activity responses

For responses to **What are (three) things you already know about programming?** people answered:

* That it's not how it looks in the movies.
* A solid foundation with the first principles will help make you language agnostic.
* It's fun; it's hard; anyone can do it.
* If you don't practice and make mistakes you'll never get better.

All of these are very true!

For **What do you plan to do with what you learn?**, one student answered "Build something for the community using just programming." That's awesome!

Later during the session, we asked students **what they had learned so far**. One student answered: "Computational thinking will help you get from concept to finished product."

## The next one

Our next workshop will be on [Saturday 11th June](http://www.meetup.com/RailsBridge-Cape-Town/events/230462308/). It's going to be a special one because we'll be celebrating 10 years of RailsBridge (our Cape Town chapter is only 3 years old, but we love a party)! If you've ever been to a workshop, we'd love to have you back of our celebration. **There will be cake!** And of course some Ruby, Rails, and more things besides.
