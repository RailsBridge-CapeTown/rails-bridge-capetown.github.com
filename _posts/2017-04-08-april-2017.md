title: RailsBridge April 2017
---

Saturday the 8th of April saw us running our 21st RailsBridge Cape Town workshop. Our students did a mix of the [Front-end](https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/frontend) and [Intro to Rails](https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/intro-to-rails) courses.


A huge thank you to our sponsors! [Prodigy Finance](https://prodigyfinance.com/) sponsored the venue, wifi, and breakfast. [OfferZen](https://www.offerzen.com/) sponsored delicious pizza for lunch. Thank you! ‚ù§

Our main organiser for the day, Emma, kicked us off with the [Share your answers](https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/workshop/activities#shareyouranswers) activity. This helped our attendees get talking to each other, and to think about what they wanted from the day. Thanks, Emma!

Steve (me!) gave our usual intro presentation, talking about why we do RailsBridge, and about the open source-ness of it.

That led into Roxanne and Evans giving our students an introduction to our tech stack of Ruby, Rails, Git, and Heroku. They explained what each piece does and how each piece relates to the other. Thanks, Roxy and Evans!

After some time coding, we gave students a break in the form of a lightning talk from someone working in the industry. This workshop, Roxy gave us a talk about journey to becoming a software developer. [View the slides of her presentation](/images/2017-04-08/Dreams.pdf) (PDF, 4.2MB). Thank you, Roxy!

The afternoon was more coding, more coffee, more HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, Git, and Heroku. And more stickers of course! :)
