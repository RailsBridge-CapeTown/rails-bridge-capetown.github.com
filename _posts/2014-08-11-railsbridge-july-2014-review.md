title: RailsBridge July 2014 Review
---

A little while ago, we held [our fifth RailsBridge Cape Town workshop](/2014-07.html). Thinking about it after the fact, perhaps we should have made more a party of it: **one year of RailsBridge workshops done, hopefully many more to come**!

As usual, we bugged our students for lots of feedback about the course and the workshop itself, and they gave us lots of great info to help make it better.

TODO: summary, venue, etc

#### Familiarity

TODO: graphic, then bullets of chart summary

We changed up our entry survey a little this time. Instead of words for the rankings, we used smileys, to try and make it a bit more friendly and informal. The smileys are ranked 1 - `>:(`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 - `:(`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 - `:-|`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 - `:)`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 - `:D`.

For the general computer-related questions (day-to-day computer tasks, Internet-related tasks, Specialised tools), **the average response from attendees was 4.5**: somewhere between :) and :D. This tells us that our students were pretty familiar with computers, and use them on a regular, if not daily, basis.

We then ask them about familiarity with development-related tools (e.g. database tools, programming languages, developer kits) and Ruby and Ruby on Rails. We ask them these two questions before and after the course. The average response for **familiarity with Development-related tools** went from 3 to 3.9. That's **an increase of about 29%, and mean they went from `:-|` to `:)`**. That's great!

The average for **familiarity with Ruby and Ruby on Rails** went from 2.6 to 4. That's an awesome **increase of about 52%, and means they went from `:(`-ish to `:)`**. That is very pleasing to see!

#### Rate, Best, Worst, Differently

70% of the students rated the workshop Really Good, and 30% rated it Good. That's great, thank you!

TODO: ^^^ chart!

We asked them what **the best thing** about the workshop was. Lots of students mentioned the friendly and helpful teachers. Teachers, you rock! People also mentioned how fun the learning was, especially for programming stuff. Another theme that came up was the inclusive and friendly environment. This is particularly happy-making: we try really hard to do this, and it's really good to hear students say that we're getting it right.

We also asked them what **the worst thing** about the workshop was. Students mentioned that all the new information can be overwhelming, and that the technical terms and language can be confusing. We're going to have another look at the Glossary, and see if we can improve it a bit more.

The last thing we ask is **what we could do differently** next time. We need to encourage closer reading of the documentation and typing the commands out, rather than copying and pasting. The "What next?" was also mentioned. This is a bit of sticking point for us, but we're trying to make it better! Over the past few events, we've improved [the resources page](http://rbcpt.org/resources/), and added RailsBridgeBridge events between the main workshops ([next one is at the end of the month](http://www.meetup.com/RailsBridge-Cape-Town/events/193291692/), come and join us!), but these need to be more obvious and explicit. We'll look at making links to these things more prominent, and talk more about what routes a student could take to continue learning.

We experimented with having lunch out of the venue, and although the food was great, we won't be doing it again. The biggest problem is time: going out as a large group to a venue is always a lengthy affair, and it makes too big a break between bits of coding.

The differences between local and heroku, specifically about running a web server, were also mentioned. We're going too add deeper explanations of this to the docs.

TODO: ^^^ slice into best, worst, differnt sections, with bullets. more slideshow-like

#### Other feedback forms

TODO: pull this into ^^^, but say that we used several sources

We also had lots of chatting to students and asking them to put up stickies on the wall whenever they found something that made them mad, glad, or sad. Here are some bullet points of things that came up. Students said that the section in the docs on deploying to heroku for first time / every time isn't clear. We either need to change the formatting a bit, or split these into separate page. They also said that the documentation needs to be clearer about saving your edits to text files.

Shared laptops are difficult. We experienced this at our [RailsBridge at the Bandwidth Barn](/2014/07/17/railsbridge-at-the-bandwidth-barn.html) recently, and it came up again here. We need to add some stuff to the documentation about clearing any existing git accounts and SSH keys, to make sure that the current user can get set up properly.


### Improvements from the April workshop

TODO: bulletise it, move it to top

Carrying on some improvements from the April workshop, we added another lightning talk. Rory reprised his "Why Software Development" talk, and we added Ben to the roster, with a talk about how Ruby on Rails is used to build really cool things.

We continued our model of collecting feedback during the day, rather than at the end of a day in a retrospective. This is still the right choice, because of the staggered leaving times of students, but we struggled a bit. We need a dedicated person to help us with this, with the right set of professional skills, like a ScrumMaster. We will be begging all the ScrumMaster we know to get one of them to be at the next one!

We made the survey more informal, and we were more vocal about it: it's mentioned in the docs again, and we talked about it at the start and end of the day. We had more responses than last time, but hopefully we can even more for the next one.


### The next one

The next official workshop will be at the end of October. If you want to come back to do one of the other courses in the curriculum, we would love to have you back! Why not bring a friend along and introduce them to the Intro to Rails course? Keep an eye on [our meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/RailsBridge-Cape-Town/) for more details closer to the time.

In the meantime, there's a RailsBridgeBridge at the end of this month: [Saturday 30th August from 11am to 2pm](http://www.meetup.com/RailsBridge-Cape-Town/events/193291692/). Come along and ask us more question about Ruby, Rails, and software development.
