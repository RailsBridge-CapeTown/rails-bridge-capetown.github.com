title: Sponsorship - RailsBridge Cape Town
---

[RailsBridge Cape Town](http://railsbridgecapetown.org/) is the local chapter of [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org/). We've been running free workshops helping people learn Rails, Ruby, HTML, and CSS [since July 2013](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/#past-events). We've had a total 16 workshops (at offices, at the Bandwidth Barn in Woodstock, and at UCT) and have had over 200 attendees. The workshops are targeted at groups of people that are underrepresented in tech; we want to help increase diversity in tech, to help all people feel welcome and comfortable in our industry.

For each workshop, we plan on 20 or 30 people. We try and keep the number around there so that we can keep a good balance of mentors to attendees. We're expecting slightly more for our July workshop since it's a RailsBridge birthday celebration (their 10th and our 3rd). All of the course material is open source and online at [docs.railsbridgecapetown.org](https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/docs/) so that students can continue with the workshop material (and other [resources](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/resources.html)) after they leave. People that do the [Intro to Rails course](https://docs.railsbridgecapetown.org/intro-to-rails/) also get guided through installing Ruby and Rails (and Git and the Heroku toolbelt and Atom) onto their machine so that they have those after the workshop too.

RailsBridge is mostly US-based, so they have a [donate-via-PayPal option](http://railsbridge.org/help/donate). There's quite a detailed [Donor FAQ](http://railsbridge.org/help/donor-faq). We are still quite informal, so we just ask for sponsorships each time to cover costs like food, drink, stationery supplies, and loot (like stickers and things) when we can.  Getting sponsorship is one of our biggest challenges for each workshop.
