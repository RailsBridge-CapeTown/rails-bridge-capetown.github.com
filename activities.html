<h1 id="activitylist">Activity List</h1>

<p>For each activity, have instructions printed out and up on a wall.</p>

<p>These are ideas and options: don't try and do them all! :)</p>

<h2 id="warm-upexercisesbeforetheworkshop" class="section-header">Warm-up exercises (before the workshop)</h2>

<h3 id="whatyouknowandwhatsyourplan">What you know, and what&#8217;s your plan</h3>

<p>Send students an email, asking</p>

<ul>
  <li>&#8220;What are three things you already know about programming?&#8221;</li>
  <li>&#8220;What do you plan to do with what you learn?&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="duringtheworkshop" class="section-header">During the workshop</h2>

<h3 id="shareyouranswers">Share your answers</h3>

<p>Each student has to ask three others about their answers to the warm-up questions, and write them down on sticky notes.</p>

<h3 id="whatdoesadeveloperlooklike">What does a developer look like?</h3>

<p>Students grab sticky notes and pens and write down answers to &#8220;What does a developer look like?&#8221;.<br />
On a separate table have cards with questions: each question requires a google search to find the answer (which is a developer somewhere in the world).<br />
Students compare their answers to the person they had found on the internet.</p>

<h3 id="whatdoesanengineerlooklike">What does an engineer look like?&quot;</h3>

<p>Students grab sticky notes and pens and write down answers to &#8220;What does an engineer look like?&#8221;</p>

<p>Students look up <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ILookLikeAnEngineer">#ILookLikeAnEngineer</a>, find an awesome person there, and introduce them to the person sitting next to them.</p>

<h3 id="goodbadchange">Good, bad, change</h3>

<p>Students write down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>one good thing;</li>
  <li>one bad thing;</li>
  <li>one thing they would change.</li>
</ul>

<p>They write one point, switch cards with someone, and write the next one.</p>

<h3 id="passthatcard">Pass That Card</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Write down a question you have.</li>
  <li>Take a card with a question on, and answer it.</li>
  <li>Take a card with an answer on, and write &#8220;agree&#8221; or &#8220;disagree.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
